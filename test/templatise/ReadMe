we can use Go's text/template package to generate the code based on a configuration file. This approach allows you to maintain a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) and then generate the Go code dynamically.

First, let's create a YAML configuration file (config.yaml):

Next, we'll create a Go program that reads this configuration file and generates the Go code:
Read the YAML configuration.
Generate the Go code using a template

For that : 
Step 1: Define the configuration structs
Create a file config.go:

Step 2: Create the Go template
Create a file template.go.tmpl:


Running the Program
Install YAML package: go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2
Run the program: go run config.go
This program will read the config.yaml file, generate the Go code, and write it to generated_code.go. You can then build and run the generated Go code as needed. This approach separates configuration from code and provides a flexible way to manage and generate code based on your configuration.
